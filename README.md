# Figura by Orqea

**Synthetic users, real friction.** Figura answers _"how would real people experience Orqea?"_
without real people: ten deterministic personas (extensible) each live a full user life in the web
app — landing, signup, email verification, login, onboarding, then the features their goals and
personality lead them to — while every step is scored for friction. A persona whose frustration
exceeds its tolerance abandons, as a real user would.

No AI: rules, weights and a seeded random generator. Same seed + same target + same catalogue ⇒
same decisions. Every report says it: _Simulation of N modelled personas, not a measurement of real users._

## What you get

- **Use-case funnel** per persona with abandon reasons and screenshots, headline funnel, coverage matrix.
- **Change reaction (A/B)**: same seed against two targets or two scenarios — who got hurt.
- **Load / usage forecast** for 100 / 1 000 / 10 000 users; **volume mode** measures p50/p95/p99.
- **Pricing / conversion** under the target's prices and your alternatives.
- **Calibration** against real aggregates (suggestions only).
- **Persona inspector**: timeline, facts, friction, the exact rule behind each decision, screenshots.

## Quick start

See [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md): `cp .env.example .env`, fill secrets, `docker compose up --build`,
open `http://localhost:4100/console`.

## Quality gates (CI and pre-commit)

Prettier, ESLint with 0 warnings, `tsc`, files ≤ 1000 lines / functions ≤ 80 lines, LF only, a
README in every folder, no skipped tests, secret scan, **100 % coverage per file**, build, e2e,
`npm audit`, `docker compose build`, smoke `up` + health checks, catalogue drift.

## Contract with Orqea

[docs/ORQEA_CONTRACT.md](docs/ORQEA_CONTRACT.md) (Orqea's real API shapes, the SSO `target` claim,
refusal codes), [docs/ORQEA_INTEGRATION.md](docs/ORQEA_INTEGRATION.md) (running inside Orqea's docker
compose: services, env vars, `FIGURA_TARGETS`) and [docs/ORQEA_UI_FACTS.md](docs/ORQEA_UI_FACTS.md)
(what Orqea's UI does not name, as friction facts).

Figura targets the Orqea environment the admin console is inspecting (`local` or `recette`, never
production): the console signs it into the SSO token and the new-run form preselects it.
